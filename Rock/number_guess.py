# Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -Sherlock        Holmes
# 
# You are given an unknown number within the range of 1 to 100, inclusive.    Your task is toguess what the number is by performing a series of guesses.
# 
# Your solution will need to guess the number by submitting aninteger divisorranging from 2 to 10,    and thenumber you guessed.    At each attempt you will get information as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the remainder result along with    your previous divisor.
# 
# You should find the number within 8 guesses. We will give you a little extra info on your first attempt...Use    it wisely young grasshopper...
# 
# Consider the following example:
# AttemptDivisorGuessSubmitResponse1299(2,99)(1,5),(1,2)Remark #1:
# You try a divisor of 2            and try your luck with 99; however, you've got a response of a list of tuples, returning the remainder of            your previous divisor and your previous divisor. ( that means you still need to guess )
# 2391(3,91)(1,5),(1,2),(2,3)Remark #2:
# Your solution suggests            91 because it passed with the response data, isn't it? ( 91%5=1; 91%2=1 ) Again, you've still got a            response. Next guess, then.3641(6,41)(1,5),(1,2),(2,3),(5,6)Remark #3:
# Your solution suggests            41 because it passed with the response data. ( 41%5=1; 41%2=1; 41%3=2 ) Again, you've still got a response.4471(4,71)(1,5),(1,2),(2,3),(5,6),(3,4)Remark #4:
# Your solution suggests            71 because it passed with the response data. ( 71%5=1; 71%2=1; 71%3=2; 71%6=5 ) Again, you've still got a            response.5and, so on...678

# You get the idea...

# Input:Information about the previous attempt. A list of tuples. Each tuple contains its remainder    and the previous divisor.

# Output:A list of integer divisors and your best guess. A list of two integers.
